This is a really easy script.
Before running this script, you should ensure your computer has connected to the drone's WI-FI.

Then you can run the script,when you enter a letter,don't forget input an enter.

First you should input 'r', then input 'f'.This time you can find the propellers are turning. Then input 'w', Propellers will turn more strongly and fly.

Second you can control by w,a,s,d,i,j,k,l.
'w' is speed up.
'a' is turning left and 'd' is turning right.
's' is to slow down(but in fact... may be it can't work well)

'j' is to move left
'l' is to move right
'i' is to move ahead
'k' is to move back

if you think you have to let the drone down,you can input 'v', which can let it stop immediatly.

In the source file, there are some test function can be used to do some test.
